# Semantic markup

## Scenario

You've been presented with a mock-up from the User Experience team for a new dashboard. 
Using the mock-up file provided, draw or highlight the main semantic elements and landmarks that
would help users of assistive technologies to navigate, find content, and determine where they are on the page.

Finally, for each block, element or group of elements, write a short sentence explaining
how it aids the user.

## Tips

- Feel free to use your drawing tool of choice (Paint, Photoshop etc) to draw on the mock-up provided
- The elements should be those which would provide semantic meaning and allow the user to find content on the page easily
- Any notes can either be included on the mock-up or in a separate file
