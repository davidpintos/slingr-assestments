# Custom elements

## Scenario

You've identified a new pattern that is being used in several new designs. You've been asked to
create a new component for this pattern that can be added to a shared component library. Using the
screenshot provided create a custom element for this component. You have some acceptance criteria
to help guide you:

Acceptance criteria

- It should be built as a web component to help with re-use
- The value and label should be flexible to allow different values
- It should support the following statuses: "Rejected", "Accepted", "Pending"

## Tips

- Consider how to make this component flexible and generic so it can be added to a shared component library
- If you've made any assumptions, feel free to write those in your code or in a separate text file
