# Sequence and reflow

## Scenario

You want to test the sequence and reflow of a new layout proposed by the design team. Using the mock-up
provided, update the index.html file to create a layout that supports the main structural
blocks highlighted in the mock-up.

## Tips

- Don't worry about the content of the blocks themselves. Feel free to use placeholder text or other methods for block content
- Use whatever tools you feel necessary including additional files and/or CDN resources if required
- CSS offers several options for layout. Think carefully about which technique(s) you would choose to create the layout and how the page would reflow at different sizes
