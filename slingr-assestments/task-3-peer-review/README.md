# Peer review

## Scenario

Another developer on your team has asked you to peer review their pull request. It includes
code for a new "Expense reports" tile. They have included a screenshot in the PR for
reference. Review their code and make suggestions for anything you believe
could be improved.

## Tips

- Review the HTML and SCSS files provided and add your comments inline
- Assume this change is part of a larger project that already has the main application and build tools setup
